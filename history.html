      <h2>Where are they from?</h2>
      <p class="home-body">Gnomes actually originated from the United Kingdom. Their creator, Sir Charles Isham, brought 21 Terra-cotta figures back from a trip to Germany, and he placed them around the gardens of his home. Eventually these iconic figures started showing up around the United States, first arriving there with Christopher Columbus in 1492.</p>
